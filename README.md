# Hereos (pronounced as "Heroes")
## Project details:
- Game being developed on the EOSIO smart contract platform.
- No ICO (in fact, the project doesn't even use a token and nobody can invest in founder items before the product is completed).
- Completely decentralized (no central website required, no data stored outside the blockchain).
- One time auction of very limited founder items which will generate a lifetime passive income for a few lucky winners.

## Gameplay details:
- Strategic battles (with billions of possible strategies) over scarce resources.
- Use your collection to engage in strategic combat, to expand your collection and/or to exchange on the open market.
- Player skill directly influences account limitations (2 players with identical collections but different skill levels will have different limitations).
- Ingenious cloning system
- Players are fully in control of item supply and market prices.
- Play solo or with your alliance.
- Real-money marketplace.

## Launch details:
- Presale auction of founder items before launch (duration TBD).
- Launch estimated late July 2018.

## Pre-launch FAQ:
### Will the game be free to play?
A free to play model is too exploitable. In Hereos, players are required to buy at least enough heroes to engage in combat (currently 6), after that the game can be played for free forever if desired. Traders and/or breeders who don't want to engage in combat require at least one hero. Players are required to "buy" RAM storage for their own inventory, but a player can sell all items and sell the RAM storage space to get the money refunded (which makes inventory storage effectively free).

### Will the game be pay to win?
Buying heroes doesn't give you any combat advantage, it only expands the amount of strategic possibilities. Better players will expand their collection faster and will likely make more money than worse players who bought a large part of their collection.

### What strategic elements are in the game?
Each time a player wants to attack or defend, the players has to assemble a squad of 6 unique heroes. Each hero has billions of combinations between the class, AI system, primary attack and the special abilities (chosen out of a list of 50+ offensive, defense or utility abilities). If you create or join an alliance, you can also coordinate attacks and defends together.

### Where can I find detailed information about the gameplay?
Until launch, the full gameplay information and source code won't be released to the public to prevent copycats (who aren't after innovation, but just want to make a quick buck) from copying the project with little to no change. But don't worry, the gameplay is quite awesome, unique and innovative :) 

### Does Hereos use a custom token?
No, all real-money exchanges are done with the native EOS token.

### Why would we trust you?
At launch all source code will be published and contract updating will be disabled to make the code immutable. It's also in my best interest to provide the most fun gameplay experience and keep the game running for as long as possible. 

Money comes secondary (even though I'm still poor haha). I could have made a beautiful teaser website and do an ICO without ever delivering a project, but I chose to work on the project first and focus on fun gameplay. It's time for innovation and progression rather than being delayed years and years by people trying to make money and never delivering!

### How far along is the project?
I've had the idea to create a decentralized real-money web game since 2015, but after researching Ethereum development it became apparent that the technology wouldn't allow a good user experience at all, so I decided not to waste months of my time and energy into it. After the release of "games" like Cryptokitties I had confirmation that I made the right decision. Then a year ago EOSIO was announced and after a little bit of research it was already clear that I could finally attempt to make a real-money game where me and the world have been waiting for for years and years.

About 6 months ago I started working on the project. The concept documentation and technical research are now completely finished. Currently I'm completing the core server code and am making it secure and efficient. Next phases that follow are: the (quite complicated) combat server code and my web client implementation. Artwork, improved UI and/or alternative clients will be up to the community since I have no budget. I will keep you up to date on the progress!

### What happens if there are severe bugs?
In case of severe bugs I will immediately pause affected game functions (even though pausing the game is obviously not in my best interest), resolve potential item-, resource or money misallocation and after fixing the bug I will request a contract update with the block producers. After launch I will reevaluate adding a bug bounty.
