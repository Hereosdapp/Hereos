# Hereos (pronounced as "Heroes")
## Project details:
- Game being developed on the EOSIO smart contract platform.
- No ICO (in fact, the project doesn't even use a token and nobody can invest in founder items before the product is completed).
- Completely decentralized (no central website required, no data stored outside the blockchain).
- One time auction of **very limited** founder items (each one has a unique attribute). Owners of founder items can set the price it costs for players to purchase a hero with the DNA of your founder item and will receive lifetime 50% commission (**there is no guarantee that the commission will outweigh your investment**). Founder items will also be tradable on the open market.

## Gameplay details:
- Strategic PvP battles (with billions of possible strategies) over scarce resources.
- Use your collection as resource to engage in strategic combat, to expand your collection and/or to exchange on the open market.
- Player skill directly influences hero collection expansion speed (if 2 players have an identical collection, the better player can expand the collection faster and also create higher demand heroes).
- Ingenious cloning system.
- Players are fully in control of item supply and market prices.
- Play solo or with your alliance.
- Real-money marketplace.

## Launch details:
- Presale auction of **very limited** founder items before launch (duration TBD).
- Launch estimated July 2018.

## Pre-launch FAQ:
### Where can I find detailed information about the gameplay?
Until launch, the full gameplay information and source code won't be released to the public to prevent copycats (who aren't after innovation, but just want to make a quick buck) from copying and releasing the project with little to no change. But don't worry, the gameplay is quite awesome, unique and innovative :) 

### Will the game be free to play?
A free to play model is too exploitable (players can make infinite accounts to get infinite resources). In Hereos, players are required to buy at least 1 hero, after that the game can be played for free forever if desired. Players are required to "buy" RAM storage for their inventory, but a player can sell all items, unregister from the game and sell the unused RAM storage space to get the money refunded (which makes inventory storage effectively free or even profitable in case the RAM price has increased because of scarcity).

### Will the game be pay to win?
Buying heroes doesn't give you any combat advantage, it only expands the amount of strategic possibilities. Better players will expand their collection faster and will likely make more money than worse players who bought a large part of their collection.

### How will you make money?
Whenever a player buys a hero, 50% of the money goes to me and the other 50% commission will be split among the founders based on the prices they individually set (founders can withdraw commission once per 24 hours to prevent blockchain bloat). When a player buys an item on the market, they pay a 1% fee. I can change both settings whenever I want after the game is live. Whenever I plan to change game settings, it will be announced at least 24 hour in advance to give people some time to prepare if needed.

### What strategic elements are in the game?
Each time a player wants to attack or defend, the player has to assemble a squad of 6 unique heroes. Each hero has billions of combinations between the class, targeting strategy, primary attack and the special abilities (50+ abilities total available divided in offensive, defense and utility categories). If you create or join an alliance, you can also coordinate attacks and defends together to improve or maintain your bonus. Bonusses are shared between alliances, so it's highly recommended to make friends.

### What will you do about bots?
It's impossible to block bots. The game is designed so that items can only come into existence after real money has been paid somewhere. After that, the players can use their virtual resources however they please. Due to the billions of possible strategies and an ever changing meta, it remains to be seen if a bot can perform as well as a skilled player.

### What if certain game settings (like overpowered strategies) are problematic?
All game settings, including all strategies, are still configurable after launch without having to update the source code. I will closely monitor everything after launch and change game settings where necessary. Whenever I plan to change game settings, it will be announced at least 24 hour in advance to give people some time to prepare if needed.

### Does Hereos use a custom token?
No, all real-money exchanges are done with the native EOS token.

### Why would we trust you?
At launch all source code will be published and contract updating will be disabled to make the code immutable. It's also in my best interest to provide the most fun gameplay experience and keep the game running for as long as possible. 

Money comes secondary (even though I'm still poor haha). I could have made a beautiful teaser website and do an ICO without ever delivering a project, but I chose to work on the project first and focus on fun gameplay. It's time for innovation and progression rather than being delayed years and years by people trying to make money and never delivering!

### How far along is the project?
I've had the idea to create a decentralized real-money web game since 2015, but after researching Ethereum development it became apparent that the technology wouldn't allow a good user experience at all, so I decided not to waste months of my time and energy on it. After the release of "games" like Cryptokitties I had confirmation that I was right about the terrible user experience Ethereum offers for games (especially for non-crypto people). Then a year ago EOSIO was announced and after a little bit of research it was already clear that I could finally attempt to make a real-money game where me and the world have been waiting for for years and years.

About 6 months ago I started working on the project. The concept documentation and technical research are now completely finished. Currently I'm completing the core server code and am making it secure and efficient. Next phases that follow are: the (quite complicated) combat server code, the website, followed by weeks of extensive private testing. Artwork, improved UI and/or alternative clients will be up to the community since I have no budget. I will keep you up to date on the progress!

### What happens if there are severe bugs?
I will do extensive private testing to eliminate as much bugs as possible before launch. After launch, only in case of severe bugs I will immediately pause affected game functions, then resolve potential item-, resource- or money misallocation and after fixing the bug(s) I will request a contract update with the block producers. Just before launch I will reevaluate adding a bug bounty.
