# Hereos (pronounced as "Heroes")
## Project details:
- Game being developed on the EOS smart contract platform.
- No ICO (in fact, the project doesn't even use a token and nobody can invest in founder items before the product is completed).
- Completely decentralized (no central website required, no data stored outside the blockchain).
- One time auction of very limited founder items which will generate a lifetime passive income for a few lucky winners.

## Gameplay details:
- 24/7 persistent strategic battles over scarce resources (with billions of possible strategies).
- Ingenious cloning system (where player skill also directly influences the frequency and quality of cloning new heroes) 
- Players are fully in control of item supply and market prices.
- Play solo or with your alliance.
- Real-money marketplace.
- Expand your collection by cloning one of billions of possible heroes, to expand your strategic possiblities or to sell them on the open market.
- Successfull attacks increase the amount of scarce resources you (and your alliance) own, which in part increases the quality of newly created clones for you and your alliance.

## Launch details:
- Presale auction of founder items before launch (duration TBD).
- Launch estimated late July 2018.

## Pre-launch FAQ:
### Will the game be free to play?
A free to play model is too exploitable. In Hereos, players are required to buy at least enough heroes to engage in combat (currently 6), after that the game can be played for free forever if desired. Traders and/or breeders who don't want to engage in combat require at least one hero. Players are required to "buy" RAM storage for their own inventory, but a player can sell all items and sell the RAM storage space to get the money refunded (which makes inventory storage effectively free).

### Will the game be pay to win?
Buying heroes doesn't give you any combat advantage, it only expands the amount of strategic possibilities. Better players will expand their collection faster and will likely make more money than worse players who bought a large part of their collection.

### What strategic elements are in the game?
Players have to assemble a squad of 6 unique heroes. Each hero has billions of combinations between the class, AI system, primary attack and has to choose 5 specific abilities out of a list of over 50 offensive, defense and utility abilities.

### Does Heroes use a custom token?
No, all real-money exchanges are done with the native EOS token.

### Why would we trust you?
At launch all source code will be published and contract updating will be disabled to make the code immutable. It's also in my best interest to provide the most fun gameplay experience and keep the game running for as long as possible. 

Money comes secondary (even though I'm still poor haha). I could have made a beautiful teaser website and do an ICO without ever delivering a project, but I chose to work on the project first and focus on fun gameplay. It's time for innovation and progression rather than being delayed years and years by people trying to make money and never delivering!

### How far along is the project?
I've been working on the project full-time for months. The concept documentation and technical research are completely finished. Currently I'm completing the core server code and making it secure and efficient. Next phases are: the (very complicated) combat code and my web client implementation. Art, improved UI and alternative clients will be up to the community since I have no budget.
